        <div class="subheading mb-5">Trainer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a basketball trainer I train at all different levels: beginner, ameteur, and professional. I used to play in the NBA for 10 years having a successful career. Basketball has been a part of my life since I was a kid. Some of the big name basketball players that I train are Steph Curry, Lebron James, Russell Westrbook, and Ja Morant. These players have become exceptional superstars in the league combining a total of nine rings. As a trainer I like to get basketball players in condition for games. Usually I make all the players that I train run at least five miles a day under seven minutes. I think it is valuable for players to be able to play the whole game if they want to win. After the training session I like to reward my players with protein boba drinks so that the player can refuel his energy for another session. I also encourage players that I train to play fantasy football because they can meet other coaches who also play. This gives them a new connection to people.<br><br>

        The basis of my training is quite simple. First stretching is very important to prevent any serious injury. As a player in the past stretching was key because when I did not stretch I got hurt. Second step in training is to warm up the body by running up and down the court at least five times. Next I make the players shoot around to get warm. I would then teach them certain combo moves that they can do. I like to end the training session with the players at least making a hundred free throws so they can perfect the easiest part of the game. As a trainer I also do strength conditioning. Pushups are the most simple but the most effective way to get your chest and shoulders stronger. I like to tell my players that I train to do at least a thousand pushups in a week to maintain and grow strength.<br><br>

        One of the hardest players that I had to train was Lebron James. He was the worst player with zero skill at all and nothing to contribute to the game. However he is considered one of the best of all time now. He trained with me every single day for thirty years. We stayed consistent everytime we worked together and it made him who he is today. At first James was only good at running and jumping. I had to teach him the fundamentals of basketball and at times James felt like it was hopeless. I made him repeat the drills over and over again until he accomplished what he wanted. Teaching him to shoot was the worst, we had to work from square one. It took us six months to teach him to shoot a free throw consistently but learning the basics made it easier for him to learn the more complex stuff. I think James has grown into a great basketball player and hopes that his career blossoms and wins a championship with Russell Westbrook for the Lakers this year.
